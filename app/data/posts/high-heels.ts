    },
    {

  tips: [
    "Look for cushioning and sturdy heel base so you can walk comfortably.",
    "Chunky heels and platforms tend to offer more balance than stilettos.",
    "Ensure ankle boots have good grip on the sole; rainy or slick surfaces can be hazardous."
  ],

  faqs: [
    {
      q: "Are platform boots better for comfort than stilettos?",
      a: "Often yes — platforms reduce the effective angle of the foot, making them easier to walk in over longer periods than sharp stilettos.",
    },
    {
      q: "How high is too high for daily wear?",
      a: "Heels around 2-3 inches are more manageable for everyday use. Higher heels (4-5+ inches) are better reserved for shorter durations or special events.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do I maintain high-heel boots and leather uppers?",
      a: "Clean regularly, use shoe trees to maintain shape, apply protectant sprays for weather protection, and store in cool, dry places."
    }
  ],

  conclusion: [
    {
      p1: "Amazing heels are more than just height — the right design, material, and fit define comfort and style."
    },
    {
      p2: "Invest in one or two bold pairs, plus a reliable daily heel, and you’ll be ready for anything 2025 throws at your wardrobe."
    },
    {
      p3: "Walking tall is a mindset — with these choices, you’ll do it in style."
